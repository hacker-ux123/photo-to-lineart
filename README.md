## What is GenLineArt?

**[GenLineArt.com](https://genlineart.com)** is an AI-powered tool designed to extract clean, aesthetic line art from photographs. 

Unlike traditional edge detection algorithms (like Canny, Sobel, or HED) which often produce messy, noisy, or "too realistic" lines, **GenLineArt** focuses on the **Anime/Manga aesthetic**. It simplifies complex details and emphasizes structural lines, making it production-ready for creative projects.
